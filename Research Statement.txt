I am interested in building usable security mechanisms, ones that will make their way out of the labs. Although my research experience so far is concentrated in the area of ubiquitous computing and mission-critical systems, my curiosity is by no means limited to that. I want to explore the realm of secure collaboration in peer-to-peer systems and scalable anonymity networks. Naturally, that also motivates me to look into the pitfalls of anonymization and how we can address that with differential privacy, especially in the context of large-scale data publishing and processing. Research that applies theories from psychology and cognitive science to study the barriers to the adoption of security policies particularly intrigues me. Additionally, I am also keen on visual querying and navigation of large software repositories to facilitate collaboration between development, operation, and security teams.
