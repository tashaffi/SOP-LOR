My first step towards security research was attempting to teach myself ethical hacking by setting up my own security lab inspired by the book A network security test lab. I learned how to locate open cameras on the internet using Google hacking. I was mesmerized by a live video of a vacation home somewhere in Denmark when it dawned on me that I was not aware of the ethical implications of my curious endeavor. 

I decided to forgo the script kiddie route and seek out professional guidance. I collaborated with Professor Tanzima Hashem (Elsevier award winner in the field of internet privacy) on an independent study that addresses the need for location-based services to evolve, according to the shift in travel priorities due to Covid-19. Our goal is to design efficient evaluation and anonymization schemes for a novel type of query called the daily itinerary scheduling query. . The query request travels from the initiator to the central server through a hop-by-hop route, where the next relay selection is based on personal trust between users. Every intermediate node in our system forwards only the most social-distance compliant aggregate trips. We developed a series of algorithms, optimizing different aspects of query processing, and are currently testing our implementation upon processing 36 million check-in data from the Gowalla dataset. 

During this project, I took inspiration from the works of Professor Mohammad Zulkernain. The classification of collaborative privacy-preserving schemes outlined in the paper Classification of Participatory Sensing Privacy Schemes and the trust-based vehicular coalition formation algorithm illustrated in the paper Trust-based Cooperative Game Model for Secure Collaboration in the Internet of Vehicles helped me refine the problem formulation for my research. I am interested in joining QRST lab not simply because of the immediately apparent overlap of interest, but the wide range of research the lab makes available, which will provide a well-rounded research experience. 

For the past several months, I have been working on a self-proposed research project under the supervision of Professor Shamsuzzoha Bayzid of BUET and Rubaiat Habib Kazi of Adobe Research, which aims to generate graphical summaries of social media posts in the form of comic strips. Our tool fully automates the comic illustration and afterward lets the user customize the comic strips' appearance using a web app that we developed. A detailed account of the project's motivation, workflow, and research results can be found on the project website. We plan to submit this work to CHI 2021. 

My experience as a software engineer at Samsung R&D and as a human-computer interaction researcher has shaped my research vision. I am interested in building practical privacy-enhancing systems that are informed by psychological models of consumer decision-making, especially in the context of ubiquitous computing and large-scale data processing. Although my experience so far is concentrated in the area of distributed security mechanisms, my curiosity is by no means limited to these topics. 

After recuperating from an initial academic setback, I managed to sharpen my analytical skills over time, as evidenced by a drastic improvement in my grades from a 3.16 junior year average to a 3.90 senior year average. Moreover, my academic and professional experience instilled in me a leadership capability that influenced my career goal: to lead an industrial research lab. The NSERC Cybersecurity CREATE program of Queen's University stands out to me as an ideal stepping stone because of the internship opportunity with industrial partners, which assures me that there is a match between my goals and the objectives of the program. The program design is uniquely aligned with my research interests as well, as it focuses heavily on the human component of security, which is evident from the social science courses included in the curriculum.
