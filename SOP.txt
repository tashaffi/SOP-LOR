My father, despite coming from a non-CS background, rather unintentionally motivated me to study cyber security. He is a maritime legislator and he would tell me anecdotes about the legal consequences of cyber-attacks on automated vehicles. It is the image of donning the blue team hat to save the unmanned ships of the future from faceless pirates that motivated me to start looking into cyber security.

I am working on an ongoing research projects under the supervision of Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid from BUET and Rubaiat Habib Kazi of Adobe Research. The aim of this project is to reduce the cognitive overload caused by going through gigabytes of text on social media by summarizing the contents by turning them into a comic strip. This project familiarized me with the challenges of research.

Before I dived deep into security, my goal was to get familiar with the fundamental . security concepts. As my undergrad curriculum did not focus on security specific courses, I signed up for the CompTIA Security+ certification exam. Studying for the exam familiarized me with malwares and attacks, identity and access management, the basics of cryptography and usage of various security assessment tools. I attempted to self-teach myself offensive security and data breaches by setting up my own security lab inspired by the book (insert link). I realized doing it without proper equipment and guidance is not only difficult, but risky.

I was fortunate to be able to start an independent data privacy related research project under Dr. Tanzima hashed mam of Buet right around this time. This research utilizes crowdsourced computation to protect data privacy in location based services, while minimizing spatial overlap over all points of interest at a given time and place. The inspiration for this work was the necessity to centrally impose constraints on human  mobility during a pandemic scenario and at the same time preserving the privacy of user preferences (not user locations). We are concerned with concealing the preferences of the user and in order to achieve that  Users share their preferences only with their trusted set of users who forward the aggregate request to their trusted users. The LSP processes the final aggregate request to their trusted users. The LSP processes the final aggregate data and returns the combined set of accepted POIs that minimize the crowd at every POI during each query processing slot. We do not eliminate a central server as the server globally minimizes the spatial overlap across all requested POIs.

I have been in the industry for more than two years now. For my software engineer
Internship, I had the opportunity to build an internal tool from scratch using
React and Python flask. I have collaborated with many clients overseas to solve their
Problems using automation. I am currently working at Samsung research and development where I am responsible for building the video call module for a mission critical push to talk app and finding security vulnerabilities of existing encryption mechanisms. (Elaborate on this, not sure whether I should keep it)

I am applying to queen's University because of their nserc cybersecurity create program. One of my  interest is the human component of security. This program focuses on the social and psychological factors in security threats with dedicated modules on this topic. The create program also provides internship opportunity.A chicken and egg problem in learning security for young researchers is that it is not advisable or expected that one can professionally pursue security without having the grasp of what they are doing, but the best way to learn it is also to tinker with real life it systems. The internship will bridge that gap. I am interested inworking under the supervision of dr- Mohammad zulkernain because of his contribution in a wide collection of security related topics. Specially his work related to connected vehicles really intrigue me because that is how my interest in security initially started.

~~~~ I have to look at student’s careers and professor's career. Also look at testimonies of previous students and what queen's wanted.

After graduating I want to contribute to offensive security and forensics. Taking on challenges and working my through seemingly hopeless situations is what shapes my professional and personal life which I believe makes this a good career choice for me and I hope I can contribute to Queen's research goals.
