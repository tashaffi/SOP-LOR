My father, a maritime legislator, rather unintentionally motivated me to study cyber security. He would tell me anecdotes about the complex futuristic legal debates on liability in case of cyber-attacks on automated vehicles. It is the image of donning the blue team hat to save the unmanned ships of the future from faceless pirates that motivated me to start looking into cyber security.

I had the privilege of studying in the topmost department of the most competitive university in Bangladesh. I experienced a significant drop in my academic performance initially due to burnout caused by my tendency to overwork myself. I focused on restructuring my all-or-nothing attitude towards achievement and in the end I graduated with the prestigious Dean's list award on all four of the final semesters for outstanding academic achievement. My ability to recuperate from major setbacks in life has shaped my research and career trajectory. I worked under the supervision of extraordinarily accomplished researchers who piqued my interest in academic research early on in my career.

I have been working on a text to comic project under the supervision of professor Dr. Md. Shamsuzzoha Bayzid of BUET and Rubaiat Habib Kazi of Adobe Research.

I plan to submit this work to chi 2021. Results from this project and more details can be found at the project website.

Before I got started with security research, my goal was to familiarize myself with the fundamentals of this field. As my undergrad curriculum did not include a security specific module, I signed up for the CompTIA Security+ certification exam. Upon getting certified, I attempted to self-teach myself ethical hacking by setting up my own security lab inspired by the book the network security test lab: a step-by-step guide. While doing this, I faced the chicken and egg problem of self-learning computer security as a young researcher. Getting hands-on experience with real life systems is essential in order to gain domain-specific expertise. On the other hand, before being confident enough with my skillset, tampering with these systems without proper guidance is not only difficult, but potentially risky.

I was fortunate to be able to start an independent data privacy related research project under Dr. Tanzima hashem mam of Buet right around this time. This research utilizes crowdsourced computation to protect data privacy in location based services, while minimizing spatial overlap over all points of interest at a given time and place. The inspiration for this work was the necessity to centrally  impose constraints on human  mobility during a pandemic scenario and at the same time preserving the privacy of user preferences (not user locations). We are concerned with concealing the preferences of the user and in order to achieve that  Users share their preferences only with their trusted set of users who forward the aggregate request to their trusted users. The LSP processes the final aggregate request to their trusted users. The LSP processes the final aggregate data and returns the combined set of accepted POIs that minimize the crowd at every POI during each query processing slot. We do not eliminate a central server as the server globally minimizes the spatial overlap across all requested POIs.
~~~~I will improve this part later. For now let us focus on the story

I am currently working as an iOS developer at Samsung research and development, where I am responsible for building the video call module for FirstNet PTT- a mission-critical-push-to-talk app used by public-safety agencies throughout the U.S. During my software engineer Internship, I was part of a team that built an instance management tool from scratch using React and Python flask. I was responsible
for software migration and contributed to the largest customer onboarding (Royal Dutch shell) in our platform. Being part of the development of practical large scale software systems fascinates me and my career aspiration is to be a research scientist in industry.

I am applying to queen's University because of their nserc cybersecurity create program. One of my  interest is the human component of security. This program focuses on the social and psychological factors in security threats with dedicated modules on this topic. The create program also provides internship opportunity.A chicken and egg problem in learning security for young researchers is that it is not advisable or expected that one can professionally pursue security without having the grasp of what they are doing, but the best way to learn it is also to tinker with real life it systems. The internship will bridge that gap. I am interested inworking under the supervision of dr- Mohammad zulkernain because of his contribution in a wide collection of security related topics. Specially his work related to connected vehicles really intrigue me because that is how my interest in security initially started.
