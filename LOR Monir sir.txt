I am delighted to recommend this student for admission to university of x's graduate program. I have been her academic advisor throughout her undergrad years, in addition to being her course and lab instructor for a senior-level course.
Tashaffi had the single most remarkable character development out of all the students I have been an advisor to. I remember having a discussion with her about her poor academic performance during her first year when she expressed that she was struggling with burnout and fatigue. I was concerned that a lack of motivation early on in her undergrad would only escalate over time and permeate her career. However, her grades started drastically changing from the fourth semester. To my surprise, she maintained a consistent upward trend. Not only did she manage to achieve stellar grades in all of the subsequent semesters, but she secured the most sought out software engineering internship opportunity in Bangladesh. Later on, she clarified how she used time-boxing to compartmentalize academic stress that ultimately got her back on track. However, I believe her relentless optimism, combined with the fact that she is an astoundingly level-headed individual, is what ultimately contributed to her resilience.
When she developed an interest in research in the specific domain of privacy and security, she reached out to a faculty member who had been working on this field and voluntarily participated in a research project under her supervision amidst her professional commitments. Tashaffi has always demonstrated a keen sense of career direction. She sets specific goals and narrows down her focus to actively seek out opportunities that will steer her towards that direction.
Another quality of her that deserves mention is that she is a skillful speaker. She would always be the designated presenter during team projects in undergrad. Her communication skills, resolution, and proactive and independent nature make her well suited to face the challenges of postgrad studies in a foreign country. Therefore, I give her my highest recommendation. If she follows the trajectory of continual growth that she has demonstrated since her undergrad, I am confident that she will excel in her career.
